/// MIDI file time division.

/// <remarks>
/// Time division specifies the meaning of the delta-times of events. There are two types of
/// the time division: ticks per quarter note and SMPTE. Time division of the first type has bit 15 set
/// to 0. In this case bits 14 thru 0 represent the number of ticks which make up a quarter-note.
/// Division of the second type has bit 15 set to 1. In this case bits 14 thru 8 contain one of the four
/// values: -24, -25, -29, or -30, corresponding to the four standard SMPTE and MIDI Time Code formats
/// (-29 corresponds to 30 drop frame), and represents the number of frames per second. Bits 7 thru 0
/// (which represent a byte stored positive) is the resolution within a frame: typical values may be 4
/// (MIDI Time Code resolution), 8, 10, 80 (bit resolution), or 100.
